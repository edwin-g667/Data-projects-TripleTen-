# Computer Vision Project

## Description
The goal of this project is to help supermarket chain Good Seed explore whether data science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by using machine learning to determine a persons age to prevent selling alcool to underage people. To accomplish this task a set of photographs of people with their ages has been provided. The loss function and mae decrease steadily through each epoch. However, the gap between training loss and mae and the validation loss and mae shows signs of extreme overfitting with the val_mae being more than double the training mae in some of the later epochs. The quality of the model is not good for determining customers ages.
